the frosh solidarity night for me is good and quite boring on my side because I don't have friends that night. I expected to meet or make new friends but I'am to shy and not a socialized person when it comes to communication and with big society. the venue of the Frosh Solidarity Night is quite nice for us to celebrate with the frosh like me and to the seniors. I learned that being in the benildean society is good for me and unique as my side because more oh my cousins is in the DLSU and Ateneo. even though im in the benildean society it doesn't mean the I will give up or regret that im in. I had been challenge to study hard in order not to be in the bottom in our family. I saw the goodness of being in the benildean and the unique of my program, yes im unique but Iam the only one who's taking up the Game Design and Development course that's why I must do my Part not to failed my subjects.
