5. Give your own personal insights about the play
 Answer:
In the second part of the play, the people can prevent the environment being destroy by natural calamity, the animals and the people around you must do their part in other to Keep the earth balanced. 
As part of the La Sallian community, I am encouraged to be the farmer of mother earth, because in the story, what happened was that everything was destroyed. What God slowly and preciously created was destroyed, to prevent and stop pollution and a remedial to the damage that the people did today.
 Another insight is that one can see some Benildean Core Values like Social Responsibility, in which we should be responsible to everything around us not only to the people but to the non-living things surrounding us and Deeply Rooted in Faith, in which we should not always lose hope in problems like pollution and because such problems were given to us as a test from God, because, He want us to take care of His creations. He also want us to plant more plants to prevent the lacks of our food supply and all the needs of our body.
