5. Give a short reflection from the production that you have seen?
Among the Benildean Core Values, I have learned more about the creativity, portrayed by the shadow play for creating shadows as 

they discuss or tell the story. Another is that of faith, portrayed by the family in the story of the shadow play.
The child had enough faith 

that her mother will return and the parents had enough faith towards God that they will eventually have a blessed and unique child, in 

which they were given, though it was one of God's angels. 
What I liked most is how the shadows told the story.
As a Benildean-

Lasallian, I am challenged to be more creative and improve on a certain ideas in which I can make a basis on how the shadow play did. 
Since I'm a 

Game Design and Development student, I can have the shadow play as basis for a certain game and make it more beautiful. the things, I learned a 

lot of the moral values presented in the story: The respect for the parents is seen there and The faith in God. The story presented 

can serve as a guide or a teaching value to every person in the audience. and it will help our own self to be a good christians and it will be followed by the childs in other to be respected and to have faith to God.
